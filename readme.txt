Hello githubbers -- this is my first real project! 
There are a NUMBER of things that are out of place here, but I figured at this stage, going public > perfect.

I've never read a readme.txt so before I do that... here's what I've got so far. 

timer.py keeps track of my independent coding practice. 
As I run it (in terminal), it registers the starting time and asks what I'm working on.
If my project doesn't exist, it creates it. 
It then prompts me to hit enter when done, at which point it registers the ending time.
After determining the total time, it tells me how long I spent and logs it to an external file (timer.csv).
It logs it twice; first to the project's header, secondly to the total time. 

Version 1 had some issues; it exported to the csv properly but had inaccuracies recording the time. 
Working on that now.
